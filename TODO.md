# TODO

- Many times the ID is obtained to later obtain metadata and then the props, it would be good to get the metadata together with the ids.
- There is too much duplicate code in the Repository due to the fact I don't see how reuse SQL queries patterns with an interpolator
- There is no logging, and I wonder what could be done keeping the pure functional way
- Handle properly scenarios where no properties are found in a GET
- Have logs
- Authentication per device
- Handle non happy paths too
- Do not display None keys in the JSON


# DONE
