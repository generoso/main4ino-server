# TODO

- Many times the id is obtained to later obtain metadata and then the props, it would be good to get the metadata together with the ids.
- There is too much duplicate code in the Repository due to the fact I don't see how reuse SQL queries patterns with an interpolator
- There is no logging, and I wonder what could be done keeping the pure functional way
